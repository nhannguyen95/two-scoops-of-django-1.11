- The official preferred way to attach ForeignKey, OneToOneField, or ManyToManyField to User is as follows:
```
from django.conf import settings
models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
```

- And don't use _get_user_model()_ for Foreign Keys to User, it's bad as it tends to create import loop.

  - django-authtools is a library that makes defining custom user models easier. Of particular use are the AbstractEmailUser and AbstractNamedUser models. Even if you donâ€™t end up using django-authtools, the source code is well worth examining.
